When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. I do not want people to very agreeable, as it saves me the trouble of liking them to a greate deal.</strong><p>The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensistivity, and an undersanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people don't just happen.</p><script type="text/javascript">const x=$('strong').html();const y=$('p').html(); setTimeout(()=>{alert("swapped!"); $('strong').html(y);$('p').html(x);},2499);</script></body></html>
